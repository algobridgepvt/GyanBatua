    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>GyanBatua</strong>. Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how this mobile application handles personal information and data.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary — short and simple</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>GyanBatua</em> does not require login, does not collect personal data, and does not use any backend servers or databases. There are no trackers, analytics, or advertising SDKs embedded in the app.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>No account, no login</h2>
    <p>
      The app does not require you to create an account or sign in. You can use the app without submitting any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>No data collection</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, process, or store personal data from users. The app does not gather identifiers (such as name, email, phone number), device identifiers, usage analytics, or any other personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>No backend, no database</h2>
    <p>
      This application operates entirely on the user's device. There is no remote backend server, cloud storage, or database used by the app to transmit or persist user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services and advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The app does not include third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking libraries. If in a future release third-party services are added, this policy will be updated and users will be informed.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The app requests only the minimal permissions required for its functionality. If no special permissions are requested, the app operates without accessing sensitive device features.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Since the app does not collect or store personal data on servers, there is no remote data to delete. Any content or settings saved locally on the device can be removed by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's local storage via the device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      This app is intended for general audiences. It does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will address your concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If changes are material (for example, if we introduce data collection, analytics, or a backend), we will update the effective date and post the revised policy here.
    </p>
